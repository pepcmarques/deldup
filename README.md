## How to use this project

The first time you run the project, it will create the configuration file and it will stops the execution.

The second time and you run the project, it will recursivelly check all the files and save entries in the database. This process takes a while.

After populating the DB, it will allow you to connect to it using your browser.

Open the browser and connect to `http://0.0.0.0:8000`

## How this project is organized

In the project root, you will find the main program `deldup.py`, `services.py`, and `settings.py`. There are other 4 (four) directories where you will find the code `app` (containing the database engine and models), `frontend` (not much), `backend` (api), and `static` (css, images, and JS code).

## How this project was implemented

I used Fastapi for the API and pure JavaScript to be able to run it anywhere. The beuty of it is to generate one executable with `pyinstaller`.

> I will prepare it asap for Mac, Linux, and Windows.
